# About me

My name is Andrew, and I'd want to introduce myself.

I am adept at handling several responsibilities on a daily basis and doing well under pressure.

In order to get the greatest outcomes, I love working in Scrum Teams and adhering to Agile, promoting professional communication and building excellent connections with others.

I recently graduated from RMIT University with a Bachelor of Information Technology and am eager to begin my career.
